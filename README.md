# Project-4
Welcome to our Final Project. In this project we will demonstrate the finite difference method to calculate the heat equation in 1-D

This repository contains:
A written report on the heat equation and finite difference method
A brief power point presentation on the finite difference method
A python file for practicing implementing the finite difference method
A python file with a working solution to the previous problem
A table of thermal diffusivities
and a few reference images
